In many situations, the ability to take multiple values and assign them to one variable is can be desired.  For example, if you want to keep track of the highest scores of a game and display them, it would help to have a running list of scores to compare against.  Arrays are a way to store values to be retrieved later.  Due to its versatile nature, it has been used in many different solutions and algorithms.

An array is usually the first data structure that is introduced due to its intuitive nature.  This is because an array is defined as an contiguous block of memory.  As such, arrays usually are defined and limited to a single type as well as the length.  There is a different form of array, considered dynamic arrays, which can adjust its length as more elements are added to the array.  However, since the memory block is defined upon initiation of the array, the array length itself can not be extended.

# Arrays: Operations
Arrays are normally zero-indexed (with the exception of some languages such as Lua) which means that the array indexes start at 0 and increases as the it is being traversed.  The usefulness of the indexes allow for elements to be stored and retrieved easily, which makes it a useful basic structure to utilize when storing data.  Arrays normally offer five operations; insertion, deletion, traversal, searching, and sorting, which make them useful in applying them to solve different problems.  The indexed property of the array allows for the elements of the data structure to be organized and retrieved in constant time, which would allow for programs to store larger amounts of data.

To demonstrate the five operations, an array which holds integers will be initialized.  Even though the operations are being applied to integers, the same actions can be applied to strings, characters, floats/doubles, booleans, all the way to objects and structures.  Arrays can even hold other arrays (Refer to 2-D Arrays [here](_pages/Data%20Structures/Arrays/Introduction%20to%20Arrays.md)).
