                            There are several types of arrays which can be serve different purposes.  While there are more types, the main focus will be on jagged arrays.  The characteristic of this data structure can be summarized as an ‘array of arrays’.  The jagged array is made of arrays of different sizes or lengths.  The jagged arrays may have some differences compared with the introduced static array.  For example, the composition of arrays adds another dimension to the structure relative to the static array.

Operations
As previously mentioned, jagged arrays set themselves apart from 2-D arrays due to the fact that it is comprised of arrays of different lengths.  This would alter how inserts, deletes, searches, and traversals are implemented.  It can also alter the runtime of the operations, due to the additional dimension which adds another layer of traversal.  By creating a code segment, it is easier to demonstrate how the operations work and are implemented.  The code to initiate the jagged array will be as follows:


The array will take in a file which has several addresses and store them in the structure.  By creating this structure, it is possible to organize text file contents into an array and make it easier to merge several text files together, for example.  While the original idea behind the jagged array is to have an array of arrays which are static, the outer array of the jagged array will be a vector instead.  Vectors are essentially dynamic arrays which can grow in order to accomodate more data than initally reserved.  This property will allow us to take in more lines from text files, which will allow us to easily concatenate two text files of addresses into one single jagged array.

Insert
After creating the jagged array structure, the first operation to work on would be the insert operation.  The steps of the insert() would go as follows:
    1. Take in the string array which represents a row in the text file.
    2. Add the string array to the vector.

Delete

Search

Traverse

                            In many situations, the ability to take multiple values and assign them to one variable is can be desired.  For example, if you want to keep track of the highest scores of a game and display them, it would help to have a running list of scores to compare against.  Arrays are a way to store values to be retrieved later.  Due to its versatile nature, it has been used in many different solutions and algorithms.

An array is usually the first data structure that is introduced due to its intuitive nature.  This is because an array is defined as an contiguous block of memory.  As such, arrays usually are defined and limited to a single type as well as the length.  There is a different form of array, considered dynamic arrays, which can adjust its length as more elements are added to the array.  However, since the memory block is defined upon initiation of the array, the array length itself can not be extended.

Arrays: Operations
Arrays are normally zero-indexed (with the exception of some languages such as Lua) which means that the array indexes start at 0 and increases as the it is being traversed.  The usefulness of the indexes allow for elements to be stored and retrieved easily, which makes it a useful basic structure to utilize when storing data.  Arrays normally offer five operations; insertion, deletion, traversal, searching, and sorting, which make them useful in applying them to solve different problems.  The indexed property of the array allows for the elements of the data structure to be organized and retrieved in constant time, which would allow for programs to store larger amounts of data.

To demonstrate the five operations, an array which holds integers will be initialized.  Even though the operations are being applied to integers, the same actions can be applied to strings, characters, floats/doubles, booleans, all the way to objects and structures.  Arrays can even hold other arrays (Refer to 2-D Arrays here). 
To start, an array should be declared as follows:
// declare an array which holds five integers
int[5] demoArray;


  Please note that the code fragments are not complete classes and are not ready to compile


Insertion
The first operation to perform on the array after declaring would be to assign values to the array.  The language that we are utilizing is C++, which means that the types of elements which can be stored in the array is defined at the declaration of the array.  There are other languages which are more flexible with types, such as Javascript and Python, however those structures are a bit different from the traditional array.  When insertion is performed on an array, it executes in constant time.
// insert the first element into the array
demoArray[0] = 1;
demoArray[1] = 2;

The code above takes the integers 1 and 2, then adds them to the index of the array.  This is added in constant time, as the insertion can simply assign the integers by index. Insertions are important since they allow for the data to be stored for later retrievals.  Insertions only can work within the range which was defined.  If an insertion was to be executed to an index that is outside of the defined range, it would result in an Out of Bounds error:
// returns an error due to the index being out of bounds
demoArray[5] = 6;


Deletion
As an static structure, arrays do not have the capability to change its size.  This makes direct deletion of elements not possible, however deletion can be mimicked.  The steps to deleting an element from the array goes as follows:


  
    Find the desired element to delete from the array: 
either through index or matching element
    Shift the remaining elements one space to the left (fill in the gap)
  


Due to the 2nd step, the deletion of an element from an static array gives the worst case runtime of O(\(n\)).  This is because the worst case assumes that the matching element is not found, thus not deleted.  This demonstrates a different runtime from the insertion operation of an static array, which has to be factored when attempting to utilize an static array for an solution.  While there is an advantage with inserting and retrieving elements from the array, deletes are a costlier operation when using the static array.  This trade off should be considered when implementing solutions to various problems.

So to demonstrate an deletion, the previously initialized demoArray would start with two elements after the insertions and end with one element.

  demoArray -&gt; [1,2]
demoArray -&gt; [0,2] , the 1 was deleted
demoArray -&gt; [2,]  , the 2 was shifted one index to the left


Here is the deletion being applied as a function:
void deleteElement(int demoArray[], int&amp; size, int element) {
    int elmIndex = -1;

    // Find the index of the element to delete
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) {
        if (demoArray[i] == element) {
            elmIndex = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    if (elmIndex == -1) {
        cout &lt;&lt; "Element not found" &lt;&lt; endl;
        return;
    }

    // Shift elements to the left
    for (int i = elmIndex; i &lt; size - 1; i++) {
        demoArray[i] = demoArray[i + 1];
    }

    // Decrease the size of the array
    size--;
}


Traversal
Traversal is a frequently used operation not only for arrays, but for other data structures as well.  Traversal is where each index or element stored on the structure is visited.  This gives traversal of the array a worst-case runtime of O(\(n\)).  Traversal is central to linear search, where the array is traversed to find a specific element in the array.  It is also utilized to print out array elements, which can be useful for debugging programs to find misallocated or misassigned variables.

Traversal starts on the first index of the array and iterates through the array until it has visited every index on the array.  For some languages, the array’s index will start at 1 (such as Lua), while others start at 0 (such as Javascript, Java, C++, and Python).  The reason is because the loop will either end at the nth index (if it starts at 1) or (n-1)th index.  The following code can be used to execute a traversal:
void traversal(int demoArray[], int&amp; arraySize) {
    // start at the beginning of the array
    int itr = 0;

    // loop through the array and print the element until the end is reached
    while(itr &lt; arraySize) {
        cout &lt;&lt; "element: " &lt;&lt; demoArray[itr] &lt;&lt; endl;
        itr++;
    }
}


Searching
Another operation which are common in arrays is searching, where the provided element is provided and the array is traversed until the desired element is found.  This is a particular style of searching called linear search which has a runtime of O(\(n\)).  There are other forms of search which has faster runtimes which will be explored in other posts, such as binary search, however the focus will be in implementation of linear search.


  Start at the first element
Check if element is matching:
If true: return true and break
Return false


The linear search is one of the introductory searches which students get familiar with and its intuitive approach to finding elements make it a general useful tool for the presented problem of finding the element in a static array.  This code segment is an implementation of a typical linear search, using the demoArray example:
int linearSearch(int demoArray[], int arraySize, int element) {
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; arraySize; i++) {
        if (demoArray[i] == element) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}


Sorting
There are several sorting algorithms which are utilized to sort array contents, however we will not explore them in depth.  Depending on the algorithm, the runtime can range from polynomial to factorial.  The algorithm that we will look at has a quadratic, or O(\(n^2\)), time.  There are several sorting algorithms that can be discussed at this runtime, such as selection and insertion sort, however we will focus on bubble sort.

The goal of all sorting algorithms, including bubble sort, is to take a static array of elements and place the elements in ascending or descending order.  While its runtime is O(\(n^2\)), it does not require any additional memory space and performs relatively well on nearly-sorted arrays.  The main problem with bubble sort is its inefficiency with larger datasets, which may cause it to be less favorable when considering real life applications.  Bubble sort is still a useful algorithm to introduce the sorting problem and work through it with an intuitive solution.

The steps of bubble sort to create an sorted array in ascending order is as follows:


  
    Start at the first index of array (\(reference_1\))
    Start \(reference_2\), traverse down the array
    At each step compare \(reference_2\) to \(reference_1\)
    Swap values if \(reference_1 &gt; reference_2\)
    Continue unitl \(reference_1\) reaches the end
  


The reason for the worst case runtime of O(\(n^2\)) is because of the amount of comparisons which are executed as the first reference is going down the list.  For each index, the algorithm traverses down the list and executes comparisons against each element giving \(n * (n-1)\) or \(n^2\) runtime.  The following is a code snippet of bubble sort:
void bubbleSort(int demoArray[], int arraySize) {
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; arraySize - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j &lt; arraySize - i - 1; j++) {
            if (demoArray[j] &gt; demoArray[j + 1]) {
                // Swap
                int temp = demoArray[j];
                demoArray[j] = demoArray[j + 1];
                demoArray[j + 1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
}



Arrays: Examples and uses
Arrays are in wide use in programming and there are many examples where arrays are appropriate to be applied.  For example, it offers a useful data storage mechanism which allows for easy retrieval.  This would make it an ideal solution for any problem which calls for easy retrieval where the index of the desired element is known.  This will take advantage of the array’s constant time retrieval.  In video games, arrays usually store the leaderboard scores which are a common place feature.  By using the sorting operation, the top scores of the game can be ranked and retrieved.

There are other uses for arrays which include listing contacts on a cell phone, image storing on a computer, and many other similar uses.

Chapter I.

In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for coursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income. The rest of it went in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches and shoes to match for holidays, while on week-days he made a brave figure in his best homespun. He had in his house a housekeeper past forty, a niece under twenty, and a lad for the field and market-place, who used to saddle the hack as well as handle the bill-hook. The age of this gentleman of ours was bordering on fifty; he was of a hardy habit, spare, gaunt-featured, a very early riser and a great sportsman. They will have it his surname was Quixada or Quesada (for here there is some difference of opinion among the authors who write on the subject), although from reasonable conjectures it seems plain that he was called Quexana. This, however, is of but little importance to our tale; it will be enough not to stray a hair’s breadth from the truth in the telling of it.

You must know, then, that the above-named gentleman whenever he was at leisure (which was mostly all the year round) gave himself up to reading books of chivalry with such ardour and avidity that he almost entirely neglected the pursuit of his field-sports, and even the management of his property; and to such a pitch did his eagerness and infatuation go that he sold many an acre of tillageland to buy books of chivalry to read, and brought home as many of them as he could get. But of all there were none he liked so well as those of the famous Feliciano de Silva’s composition, for their lucidity of style and complicated conceits were as pearls in his sight, particularly when in his reading he came upon courtships and cartels, where he often found passages like “the reason of the unreason with which my reason is afflicted so weakens my reason that with reason I murmur at your beauty;” or again, “the high heavens, that of your divinity divinely fortify you with the stars, render you deserving of the desert your greatness deserves.” Over conceits of this sort the poor gentleman lost his wits, and used to lie awake striving to understand them and worm the meaning out of them; what Aristotle himself could not have made out or extracted had he come to life again for that special purpose. He was not at all easy about the wounds which Don Belianis gave and took, because it seemed to him that, great as were the surgeons who had cured him, he must have had his face and body covered all over with seams and scars. He commended, however, the author’s way of ending his book with the promise of that interminable adventure, and many a time was he tempted to take up his pen and finish it properly as is there proposed, which no doubt he would have done, and made a successful piece of work of it too, had not greater and more absorbing thoughts prevented him.

Many an argument did he have with the curate of his village (a learned man, and a graduate of Siguenza) as to which had been the better knight, Palmerin of England or Amadis of Gaul. Master Nicholas, the village barber, however, used to say that neither of them came up to the Knight of Phoebus, and that if there was any that could compare with him it was Don Galaor, the brother of Amadis of Gaul, because he had a spirit that was equal to every occasion, and was no finikin knight, nor lachrymose like his brother, while in the matter of valour he was not a whit behind him. In short, he became so absorbed in his books that he spent his nights from sunset to sunrise, and his days from dawn to dark, poring over them; and what with little sleep and much reading his brains got so dry that he lost his wits. His fancy grew full of what he used to read about in his books, enchantments, quarrels, battles, challenges, wounds, wooings, loves, agonies, and all sorts of impossible nonsense; and it so possessed his mind that the whole fabric of invention and fancy he read of was true, that to him no history in the world had more reality in it. He used to say the Cid Ruy Diaz was a very good knight, but that he was not to be compared with the Knight of the Burning Sword who with one back-stroke cut in half two fierce and monstrous giants. He thought more of Bernardo del Carpio because at Roncesvalles he slew Roland in spite of enchantments, availing himself of the artifice of Hercules when he strangled Antaeus the son of Terra in his arms. He approved highly of the giant Morgante, because, although of the giant breed which is always arrogant and ill-conditioned, he alone was affable and well-bred. But above all he admired Reinaldos of Montalban, especially when he saw him sallying forth from his castle and robbing everyone he met, and when beyond the seas he stole that image of Mahomet which, as his history says, was entirely of gold. To have a bout of kicking at that traitor of a Ganelon he would have given his housekeeper, and his niece into the bargain.

In short, his wits being quite gone, he hit upon the strangest notion that ever madman in this world hit upon, and that was that he fancied it was right and requisite, as well for the support of his own honour as for the service of his country, that he should make a knight-errant of himself, roaming the world over in full armour and on horseback in quest of adventures, and putting in practice himself all that he had read of as being the usual practices of knights-errant; righting every kind of wrong, and exposing himself to peril and danger from which, in the issue, he was to reap eternal renown and fame. Already the poor man saw himself crowned by the might of his arm Emperor of Trebizond at least; and so, led away by the intense enjoyment he found in these pleasant fancies, he set himself forthwith to put his scheme into execution.

The first thing he did was to clean up some armour that had belonged to his great-grandfather, and had been for ages lying forgotten in a corner eaten with rust and covered with mildew. He scoured and polished it as best he could, but he perceived one great defect in it, that it had no closed helmet, nothing but a simple morion. This deficiency, however, his ingenuity supplied, for he contrived a kind of half-helmet of pasteboard which, fitted on to the morion, looked like a whole one. It is true that, in order to see if it was strong and fit to stand a cut, he drew his sword and gave it a couple of slashes, the first of which undid in an instant what had taken him a week to do. The ease with which he had knocked it to pieces disconcerted him somewhat, and to guard against that danger he set to work again, fixing bars of iron on the inside until he was satisfied with its strength; and then, not caring to try any more experiments with it, he passed it and adopted it as a helmet of the most perfect construction.

He next proceeded to inspect his hack, which, with more quartos than a real and more blemishes than the steed of Gonela, that “tantum pellis et ossa fuit,” surpassed in his eyes the Bucephalus of Alexander or the Babieca of the Cid. Four days were spent in thinking what name to give him, because (as he said to himself) it was not right that a horse belonging to a knight so famous, and one with such merits of his own, should be without some distinctive name, and he strove to adapt it so as to indicate what he had been before belonging to a knight-errant, and what he then was; for it was only reasonable that, his master taking a new character, he should take a new name, and that it should be a distinguished and full-sounding one, befitting the new order and calling he was about to follow. And so, after having composed, struck out, rejected, added to, unmade, and remade a multitude of names out of his memory and fancy, he decided upon calling him Rocinante, a name, to his thinking, lofty, sonorous, and significant of his condition as a hack before he became what he now was, the first and foremost of all the hacks in the world.

Having got a name for his horse so much to his taste, he was anxious to get one for himself, and he was eight days more pondering over this point, till at last he made up his mind to call himself “Don Quixote,” whence, as has been already said, the authors of this veracious history have inferred that his name must have been beyond a doubt Quixada, and not Quesada as others would have it. Recollecting, however, that the valiant Amadis was not content to call himself curtly Amadis and nothing more, but added the name of his kingdom and country to make it famous, and called himself Amadis of Gaul, he, like a good knight, resolved to add on the name of his, and to style himself Don Quixote of La Mancha, whereby, he considered, he described accurately his origin and country, and did honour to it in taking his surname from it.

So then, his armour being furbished, his morion turned into a helmet, his hack christened, and he himself confirmed, he came to the conclusion that nothing more was needed now but to look out for a lady to be in love with; for a knight-errant without love was like a tree without leaves or fruit, or a body without a soul. As he said to himself, “If, for my sins, or by my good fortune, I come across some giant hereabouts, a common occurrence with knights-errant, and overthrow him in one onslaught, or cleave him asunder to the waist, or, in short, vanquish and subdue him, will it not be well to have some one I may send him to as a present, that he may come in and fall on his knees before my sweet lady, and in a humble, submissive voice say, ‘I am the giant Caraculiambro, lord of the island of Malindrania, vanquished in single combat by the never sufficiently extolled knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, who has commanded me to present myself before your Grace, that your Highness dispose of me at your pleasure’?” Oh, how our good gentleman enjoyed the delivery of this speech, especially when he had thought of some one to call his Lady! There was, so the story goes, in a village near his own a very good-looking farm-girl with whom he had been at one time in love, though, so far as is known, she never knew it nor gave a thought to the matter. Her name was Aldonza Lorenzo, and upon her he thought fit to confer the title of Lady of his Thoughts; and after some search for a name which should not be out of harmony with her own, and should suggest and indicate that of a princess and great lady, he decided upon calling her Dulcinea del Tobosoâ€”she being of El Tobosoâ€”a name, to his mind, musical, uncommon, and significant, like all those he had already bestowed upon himself and the things belonging to him.

Synopsis

The prologue of Romeo and Juliet calls the title characters “star-crossed lovers”—and the stars do seem to conspire against these young lovers.

Romeo is a Montague, and Juliet a Capulet. Their families are enmeshed in a feud, but the moment they meet—when Romeo and his friends attend a party at Juliet’s house in disguise—the two fall in love and quickly decide that they want to be married.

A friar secretly marries them, hoping to end the feud. Romeo and his companions almost immediately encounter Juliet’s cousin Tybalt, who challenges Romeo. When Romeo refuses to fight, Romeo’s friend Mercutio accepts the challenge and is killed. Romeo then kills Tybalt and is banished. He spends that night with Juliet and then leaves for Mantua.

Juliet’s father forces her into a marriage with Count Paris. To avoid this marriage, Juliet takes a potion, given her by the friar, that makes her appear dead. The friar will send Romeo word to be at her family tomb when she awakes. The plan goes awry, and Romeo learns instead that she is dead. In the tomb, Romeo kills himself. Juliet wakes, sees his body, and commits suicide. Their deaths appear finally to end the feud.

                            What is Lorem Ipsum?

This is an example post ‘&lt;’. Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

Why do we use it?

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using ‘Content here, content here’, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for ‘lorem ipsum’ will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

Where does it come from?

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..”, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

Where can I get some?

There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don’t look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn’t anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
